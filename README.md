# React Hook Combobox
> React hook for building accessible comboboxes

A smaller, not as feature-packed, but as accessible alternative to Downshift.

React Hook Combobox is built to the [WAI-ARIA specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#combobox) for comboboxes. It follows a bring-your-own principle, which gives consumers full ownership of:

- markup: render any UI you want
- data: use any data structure you want
- filter: use any function to filter your data

This combines ultimate flexibility with a tiny footprint (3.8kB).
